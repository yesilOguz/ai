you must download all of the npy files [in this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KmpdJQ4YwI6yuS6JMcwPX_h4CKuR-TMn?usp=sharing) or download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog) and create this files manually

if you want try run only main script but If you want to change the dataset, you need to run the prepareDatas script.

I resized the images to 64x64 and used the convert method of the pillow library to make it single channel.
